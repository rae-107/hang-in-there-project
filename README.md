# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
A motivational poster creator webpage that will load a random poster on page load. the webpage has functional buttons that the user can use to navigate to separate pages, save posters in a grid format, access a form to create a customized poster. There is also a double click delete functionality that will remove saved posters on the saved page.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Open up https://github.com/rae-107/hang-in-there-project repository. From this page if someone wanted to clone down our code, the would first fork the code, then using the green 'code' button, copy the link. With that link, in their local terminal they will follow the git clone steps to save to their local machine. 

1) open terminal
2) cd into preferred directory
3) git clone <example: git@github.com:rae-107/hang-in-there-project.git> in green 'code' button
4) cd into clone repository
5) open up your text editor
