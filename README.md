[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Open up https://github.com/rae-107/hang-in-there-project repository. From this page if someone wanted to clone down our code, the would first fork the code, then using the green 'code' button, copy the link. With that link, in their local terminal they will follow the git clone steps to save to their local machine.
